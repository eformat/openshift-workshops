## Deployment techniques and Pipelines using Jenkins

In this lab we are going to learn about pipeline integration with OpenShift.

We are going to run through a number of pipeline examples demonstrating common build and deployment techniques, including:

* Simple pipeline - the 'HelloWorld' example
* Blue-Green pipeline
* A/B pipeline 
* Multi-project pipeline

The multi-project example will focus on the build / tag / promote lifecycle using our CI/CD tooling - Jenkins.

`DO NOT DO THIS - The pre-reqs have already been done for this lab environment` 

Let's run through the setup so you can repeat in other environments...

We will be using Jenkins image streams in our OpenShift environment:

[source]
----
oc import-image --all --insecure=true --confirm -n openshift docker.io/openshift/jenkins-2-centos7
oc import-image --all --insecure=true --confirm -n openshift registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7
----

Jenkins contains the followig necessary plugins:

image::/images/15-pipeline-components.png[Pipeline Components,800,align="center"]

Load the following templates for Jenkins if they are not present in your OpenShift environment:

[source]
----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/master/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.6/quickstart-templates/jenkins-ephemeral-template.json -n openshift
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/master/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.6/quickstart-templates/jenkins-persistent-template.json -n openshift
----

Load the sample application template as well:

[source]
----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/samplepipeline.yaml -n openshift
----

The OpenShift cluster should be configured to automatically provision Jenkins by setting the following cluster wide configuration in "master-config.yaml"

[source]
----
    jenkinsPipelineConfig:
        autoProvisionEnabled: true
        parameters:
          JENKINS_IMAGE_STREAM_TAG: jenkins-2-rhel7:latest
          ENABLE_OAUTH: "true"
        serviceName: jenkins
        templateName: jenkins-persistent
        templateNamespace: openshift
----

The source code for these jenkins images is in github - https://github.com/openshift/jenkins and examples of its use
can be found here - https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/jenkins and here - https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin
for the jenkins kubernetes plugin.

### A Simple Pipeline

Login, and create a project named "samplepipeline-{{USER_NAME}}"

[source]
----
oc login -u {{USER_NAME}} -p {{USER_PASSWORD}}
oc new-project samplepipeline-{{USER_NAME}} --display-name="Pipeline Sample" --description='Pipeline Sample'
----

We can then create our sample application from template:

[source]
----
oc new-app jenkins-pipeline-example 
----

We could also have used the webui to create the application from this template using the "Add to Project" button:

image::/images/15-jenkins-pipeline-template.png[Pipeline Template,800,align="center"]

A mongodb and jenkins pod should be provisioned into your project. We can browse to the "Build", "Pipeline", "Configuration" and see the 
groovy DSL Jenkinsfile for this pipeline.

image::/images/15-simple-pipeline.png[A Simple Pipeline,1100,align="center"]

The "openshiftBuild" and "openshiftDeploy" method calls are from the Jenkins OpenShift Pipeline plugin.

Start the pipeline build from the web-ui by selecting "Start Build" or:

[source]
----
oc start-build sample-pipeline
----

image::/images/15-simple-pipeline-run.png[Running a Simple Pipeline,800,align="center"]

Note how the "node()" from the Jenkinsfile DSL is being run in a pod that starts a build pod for our application:

[source]
----
oc get pods

NAME                             READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
jenkins-1-11fa6                  1/1       Running     0          9m
mongodb-1-g84t4                  1/1       Running     0          9m
nodejs-2fc075ffd1b7              1/1       Running     0          2m    <1>
nodejs-mongodb-example-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1m    <2>
nodejs-mongodb-example-1-tfh02   1/1       Running     0          13s   <3>
----
<1> Node Pod
<2> Build Pod
<3> Running Application

If you browse to the running application URL, you can see a simple page count that increments on every visit and is stored in the mongodb.

image::/images/15-simple-jenkins-running-application.png[The running application,400,align="center"]

*(Optional) Accessing the Database*

We can connect to the mongodb to look at the generated data. First we need to get the database credentials that was generated (its an environment variable) - you can find the password using the CLI or browsing to the "Pods" -> "Environment" in the UI:

[source]
----
oc env dc mongodb --list | grep MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD

MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=H0XosoaAxsOhpbJq
----

Use this password to connect to mongodb from the command line:

[source]
----
oc rsh $(oc get pods -l name=mongodb -o name)
mongo -u admin -p <admin password> --authenticationDatabase admin
> show databases
> use sampledb
> show collections
> db.counts.find();

{ "_id" : ObjectId("58a4d26daf987c001805092f"), "ip" : "172.17.0.1", "date" : 1487196781386 }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("58a4d277af987c0018050930"), "ip" : "172.17.0.1", "date" : 1487196791551 }
...
----

This shows us the data is stored as one row per page hit per ip address.

### Blue-Green Pipeline

The blue-green deployment strategy minimizes the time it takes to perform a deployment cut-over by ensuring you
have two (or more) versions of your application stacks available during the deployment.

We can make use of the service and routing tiers
in OpenShift to easily switch between our two running application stacks - hence it is very simple and fast to perform a rollback.

image::/images/15-blue-green-deployments.png[Blue Green Deployments,800,align="center"]

Let's create a new project:

[source]
----
oc new-project bluegreen-{{USER_NAME}} --display-name="Blue Green Deployments" --description="Blue Green Deployments"
----

Lets deploy both our blue and green applications into the same project:

[source]
----
oc new-app "https://github.com/devops-with-openshift/bluegreen#master" --name=blue
oc new-app "https://github.com/devops-with-openshift/bluegreen#green" --name=green
----

We care going to expose services for our endpoints so we can test them independently, and point the 'bluegreen' route to the blue service.

[source]
----
oc expose service blue --name=bluegreen
oc expose service blue --name=blue
oc expose service green --name=green
----

Create the blue-green pipeline:

[source]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eformat/bluegreen/master/bluegreen-pipeline.yaml
----

Once the applications are built and deployed, you should be able to browse to the bluegreen service:

image::/images/15-bluegreen-app.png[Blue Service application,800,align="center"]

Now, it is possible to manually switch the routes via the web-ui or CLI:

[source]
----
oc patch route/bluegreen -p '{"spec":{"to":{"name":"green"}}}'
oc patch route/bluegreen -p '{"spec":{"to":{"name":"blue"}}}'
----

We have automated this switch into a Jenkisfile pipeline as code. Start the pipeline build:

[source]
----
oc start-build bluegreen-pipeline
----

Once the pod that runs the pipeline instruction starts, you should see the running pipeline:

image::/images/15-bluegreen-in-progress.png[Blue Green pipeline in progress,800,align="center"]

A build and deployment of the application version that is `not` currently routed to via the `bluegreen` route (i.e. either blue or green) will run.

There is a manual input task to approve switching the bluegreen route. Select 'Input Required' and login to Jenkins:

image::/images/15-bluegreen-approve.png[Blue Green pipeline approval,800,align="center"]

You can browse to the URL first to ensure this the desired 'green', select 'Proceed':

image::/images/15-bluegreen-green.png[Green Service application,800,align="center"]

Once completed the 'bluegreen' route will show 'green' instead of 'blue'. You can shoose to 'Rollback' the change as well.

*(Optional) Configure a Webhook to call the pipeline*

Fork the github project using *your GitHub account*:

[source]
----
https://github.com/devops-with-openshift/bluegreen
----

In Github browse to Project -> Settings -> WebHooks -> Add WebHook

Don't enable SSL verification in github (we are using self signed certificates) else you will get a "Peer certificate" authentication error.

Enter the webhook copied from OpenShift -> Project -> Builds -> Pipelines -> blugreen-pipeline -> Configuration -> GitHub WebHook URL which looks like:

[source]
----
Payload URL: https://<master api server>:8443/oapi/v1/namespaces/bluegreen-{{USER_NAME}}/buildconfigs/bluegreen-pipeline/webhooks/<secret>/github
----

Patch the source references in your project to use your github fork:

++++
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
oc patch bc/blue -p '{"spec":{"source":{"git":{"uri":"https://github.com/your github username/bluegreen.git","ref": "master"}}}}' --type=strategic -n bluegreen-{{USER_NAME}}
oc patch bc/green -p '{"spec":{"source":{"git":{"uri":"https://github.com/your github username/bluegreen.git","ref": "green"}}}}' --type=strategic -n bluegreen-{{USER_NAME}}
</code>
</pre>
++++

You can now make edits to files in GitHub and these will trigger a build of your OpenShift pipeline.

### A/B Pipeline

OpenShfit's exposes API's to manipulate the Routing tier. We can use this to create an A/B pipeline from our previous bluegreen example.

A/B deployments get their name from the ability to test the new application features as part of the deployment. This way you can create a hypothesis, perform an A/B
deployment, test whether your hypothesis is true or false and either rollback to your initial application state (A) or proceed with your new application state (B).

image::/images/15-ab-deployment.png[A/B Deployments,800,align="center"]

Let's create weighted route backends for our application. We need to change the default load balancing behaviour from 'least-connection' to 'round-robin'

[source]
----
oc annotate route/bluegreen haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance=roundrobin
oc set route-backends routes/bluegreen blue=100 green=0
----

Let's also create our ab-pipeline and start it from the CLI or web-ui:

[source]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eformat/bluegreen/master/ab-pipeline.yaml
oc start-build ab-pipeline
----

image::/images/15-ab-pipeline.png[A/B Deployment pipeline,400,align="center"]

If we set the weights for our services:

image::/images/15-ab-adjust-routes.png[Adjust the routes,400,align="center"]

We can test that 80% of traffic is going to our 'A' (blue) version, and 20% is going to our 'B' (green) version:

[source]
----
for x in {1..10}; do curl -s http://bluegreen-bluegreen-{{USER_NAME}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ | grep -q blue && echo $x blue || echo $x green; done

1 blue
2 blue
3 blue
4 blue
5 green
6 blue
7 blue
8 blue
9 blue
10 green
----

Because the default configuration for HAProxy is to honour sticky sessions using cookies, we can see this in a Browser or from CLI (always get the same version):

[source]
----
for x in {1..10}; do curl -c /tmp/cookie -b /tmp/cookie -s http://bluegreen-bluegreen-{{USER_NAME}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}} | grep -q blue && echo $x blue || echo $x green; done

1 blue
2 blue
3 blue
4 blue
5 blue
6 blue
7 blue
8 blue
9 blue
10 blue
----

image::/images/15-ab-weights.png[Route weighting,1000,align="center"]

### Multi Project Pipeline

Ideally we want to build our immutable application images once then tag the images for promotion into other projects - to perform our pipeline activities such as testing and eventually production deployment. The feedback from our various activities forms the gates for downstream activities. The basics of build, tag and promote forms the foundation for every container based application to flow through our delivery lifecycle.

image::/images/15-multi-project-pipeline.png[Multi project pipeline,800,align="center"]

We are going to setup four projects for our pipeline activities:

* cicd-{{USER_NAME}} - containing our Jenkins instance
* development-{{USER_NAME}} - for building and developing our application images 
* testing-{{USER_NAME}} - for testing our application
* production-{{USER_NAME}} - hosting our production application

Create the projects:

[source]
----
oc new-project cicd-{{USER_NAME}} --display-name='CICD Jenkins' --description='CICD Jenkins'
oc new-project development-{{USER_NAME}} --display-name='MyApp Development' --description='MyApp Development'
oc new-project testing-{{USER_NAME}} --display-name='MyApp Testing' --description='MyApp Testing'
oc new-project production-{{USER_NAME}} --display-name='MyApp Production' --description='MyApp Production'
----

Provide the jenkins service account in the cicd project access to our other projects:

[source]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:cicd-{{USER_NAME}}:jenkins -n development-{{USER_NAME}}
oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:cicd-{{USER_NAME}}:jenkins -n testing-{{USER_NAME}}
oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:cicd-{{USER_NAME}}:jenkins -n production-{{USER_NAME}}
----

Allow the testing and production service accounts to pull images from the development namespace:

[source]
----
oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:testing-{{USER_NAME}} -n development-{{USER_NAME}}
oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:production-{{USER_NAME}} -n development-{{USER_NAME}}
----

Your should now have these projects:

image::/images/15-multi-projects.png[Multiple projects,800,align="center"]

We can deploy our Jenkins container now:

[source]
----
oc new-app -n cicd-{{USER_NAME}} --template=jenkins-persistent -p JENKINS_IMAGE_STREAM_TAG=jenkins-2-centos7:latest -p NAMESPACE=openshift -p MEMORY_LIMIT=2048Mi -p ENABLE_OAUTH=true
----

And create the pipeline:

[source]
----
oc create -n cicd-{{USER_NAME}} -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eformat/pipeline-configs/master/pipeline.yaml
----

Lets create our development application using Source to Image.

[source]
----
oc project development-{{USER_NAME}}
oc new-app openshift/php:7.0~https://github.com/devops-with-openshift/cotd.git#master --name=myapp
oc expose service myapp --hostname=cotd-development-{{USER_NAME}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}} --name=myapp
----

Let's setup our testing project, using the image from development and changing the image pull policy to always.

[source]
----
oc project testing-{{USER_NAME}}
oc create dc myapp --image={{REGISTRY_ADDRRESS}}/development-{{USER_NAME}}/myapp:promoteQA
oc patch dc/myapp -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"default-container","imagePullPolicy":"Always"}]}}}}'
oc expose dc myapp --port=8080
oc expose service myapp --hostname=cotd-testing-{{USER_NAME}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}} --name=myapp
----

We are using the arbitrary :promoteQA image tag for the testing deployment (which doesn't yet exist)

We also patch the image pull policy to *Always* pull built images rather than the default, which is *IfNotPresent* on the node.

We can do the same setup for the production project using the promotePRD image tag:

[source]
----
oc project production-{{USER_NAME}}
oc create dc myapp --image={{REGISTRY_ADDRRESS}}/development-{{USER_NAME}}/myapp:promotePRD
oc patch dc/myapp -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"default-container","imagePullPolicy":"Always"}]}}}}'
oc expose dc myapp --port=8080
oc expose service myapp --hostname=cotd-production-{{USER_NAME}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}} --name=myapp
----

Now we are ready to run our pipeline deployment from the cicd-{{USER_NAME}} project.

[source]
----
oc start-build pipeline -n cicd-{{USER_NAME}}
----

The first step will log you in to Jennkins via OAuth and query you for your project paramterised username

image::/images/15-username-pipelines.png[Project Username Parameter,400,align="center"]

Once the image is built and deployed in development, it is tagged 'promoteQA' and deployed into the testing project.

image::/images/15-approve-production.png[Approve to Production,800,align="center"]

You can test the application, and them manually approve the image tagging/promotion to the production project.

image::/images/15-running-application.png[Running Application,800,align="center"]
