## Lab: Zero Downtime Deployment; Externalizing Application Configuration; Hot Reconfiguration; Application Performance Managment

### Background: 
Once you build your applications, you can guarantee that you will need to change them ! Requihawkular-nts change, system functionality
evolves, defects need to be fixed.

We want to ensure that frequent deployments do not impact the availability of our services. And this is where the Zero Downtime Deployment
(ZDD) comes in. This allows you to deploy a new version of your service without interrupting the operation of the service.

Most applications require configuration using environment variables, configuration files and command line arguments. These configuration artifacts
should be externalized form the application and the immutable image content in order to keep the image portable across our environments.

In this lab we are going to learn about using Openshift to deploy a REST web service and demonstrate various configuration aspects to achieve ZDD.
We'll also demonstrate hot reconfiguration capabilites and application performance managment along the way.

The application stack consists of supported RedHat tools from open source projects including

- Java - http://openjdk.java.net/
- Camel - http://camel.apache.org/
- SpringBoot - https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/
- Fabric8 - https://fabric8.io/
- Hawkular APM - http://www.hawkular.org/hawkular-apm/

### Prerequisites

`The pre-reqs have already been done for this lab` 

Let's run through the setup so you can repeat in other environments...

##### Nexus

We are going to be building and deploying a Java application. We have deployed a nexus container with a persistent volume claim to cache the
 maven dependencies required to build the example application. This speeds up our builds as well as saving bandwidth.

[source]
---- 
oc new-project nexus --display-name="Nexus" --description="Nexus"
oc project nexus
oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eformat/openshift-nexus/master/nexus.yaml
----

Once the nexus pod has deployed we install the following maven proxy repositories as the *admin/admin123* user:

[options="header"]
|=======
| Repo Name | URL | Type
| jboss-ga | http://maven.repository.redhat.com/techpreview/all | Release
| fusesource.m2 | https://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/content/groups/public | Release
| repository.jboss.org | http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public | Mixed
| fusesource.ea | https://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/content/groups/ea | Release
| redhat.ga | https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga | Release
|=======

image::/images/28-nexus-repos.png[Nexus Repository Manager,800,align="center"]

The example application source code contains an override maven settings file that points to this nexus repo. The Source To Image (S2I) java
builder will use this file:

* https://github.com/eformat/camel-springboot-rest-ose/blob/master/configuration/settings.xml

##### Java S2I Image

We are going to leverage the Red Hat Java S2I builder image for building and running fat-jar and flat classpath apps

[source]
---- 
oc import-image -n openshift registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift --confirm --all
----

If you are a Red Hat customer, the container catalogue gives you details on this image:

image::/images/28-redhat-image-catalog.png[Red Hat Container Catalogue,800,align="center"]

A community based equivalent image is `docker.io/fabric8/java-jboss-openjdk8-jdk`

##### Hawkular APM Agent

We are going to leverage Hawkular Application Performance Managment later in the lab. So, we have layered ontop of the base S2I Java image
the Hawkular agent using a *Dockerfile*

* https://github.com/eformat/hawkular-apm-template/blob/master/Dockerfile

The image has been built and deployed into the shared openshift namespace:

[source]
---- 
git clone https://github.com/eformat/hawkular-apm-template
cd hawkular-apm-template
oc login -u admin -p admin
oc project openshift
oc new-build --binary --name=spring-boot-apm
oc start-build spring-boot-apm --from-dir=. --follow
----

We have created an application template that uses the spring-boot-apm image and loaded it into Openshift:

[source]
---- 
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eformat/hawkular-apm-template/master/templates/spring-boot-apm-template.json -n openshift
----

We have also loaded the Hawkular APM server template and loaded it into OpenShift:

[source]
---- 
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eformat/hawkular-apm-template/master/templates/hawkular-apm-server.yml
----

##### Reference Links

* https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/hawkular-apm/tree/master/openshift-templates


### Now you get your hands dirty, build and deploy the application

`Remember` to substitute the username with your own id.

Login and create a project for our SpringBoot application:

[source]
---- 
oc new-project helloservice-username --display-name="Helloservice" --description="Helloservice"
----

We are going to allow our default service account to *view* the kubernetes api (this is for our spring hot reload function later on)

[source]
---- 
oc policy add-role-to-user view --serviceaccount=default -n $(oc project -q)
----

Build and deploy the application using the *spring-boot-apm* template and S2I image we built and loaded in the Prerequisites 

[source]
----
oc new-app --template=spring-boot-apm -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL="https://github.com/eformat/camel-springboot-rest-ose.git" -p APPLICATION_NAME=camel-springboot-rest

--> Deploying template "spring-boot-apm" in project "openshift"

     spring-boot-apm
     ---------
     Application template for Spring Boot applications built using S2I and supporting Hawkular APM.

     * With parameters:
        * APPLICATION_NAME=camel-springboot-rest
        * HOSTNAME_HTTP=
        * SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/eformat/camel-springboot-rest-ose.git
        * SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=master
        * CONTEXT_DIR=/
        * GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=VvXDC1LY # generated
        * GENERIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET=omW14ntS # generated
        * IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE=openshift

--> Creating resources with label app=spring-boot-apm ...
    service "camel-springboot-rest" created
    route "camel-springboot-rest" created
    imagestream "camel-springboot-rest" created
    buildconfig "camel-springboot-rest" created
    deploymentconfig "camel-springboot-rest" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/camel-springboot-rest' to track its progress.
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

A build should start and the java dependencies will be pulled from the Nexus server.

*(Optional)*
For the developers who want to build the application locally:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/eformat/camel-springboot-rest-ose
cd camel-springboot-rest-ose
mvn spring-boot:run
----

Once the image has been built and deployed to the registry, a single pod should be running. We can see a warning about Health Checks which we are going
to deal with in a minute.

image::/images/28-springboot-apm-pod.png[SpringBoot APM Pod,700,align="center"]

### Configuring application behaviour

##### Application properties files

If we browse to our application, we should see that a Swagger-UI - http://swagger.io/ has been deployed to the root of our application.

There is an bug with our generated swagger documentation - it does not know what our exposed route URL is. As a workaround we set an environment
 variable to point to our exposed application for the swagger documentation:

++++
<pre class="highlight">
<code>oc env dc/camel-springboot-rest SWAGGERUI_HOST=$(oc get route camel-springboot-rest --template='&#123;{ .spec.host }}')</code>
</pre>
++++

If we try out our Helloservice in the swagger-ui, it should return a Response

[source,role=copypaste]
----
"Default Prop Hi mike ! from pod: camel-springboot-rest-2-wt91a"
----

image::/images/28-swagger-reposnse.png[Swagger Helloservice,800,align="center"]

The `Default Prop Hi` greeting is set in the spring application properties file

* https://github.com/eformat/camel-springboot-rest-ose/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties#L29


image::/images/28-spring-properties.png[Spring Properties File,600,align="center"]

This is bound into the application using the spring @ConfigurationProperties annotaion

* https://github.com/eformat/camel-springboot-rest-ose/blob/master/src/main/java/org/example/ApplicationConfigBean.java#L7

image::/images/28-spring-properties-annotation.png[Spring Configuration,600,align="center"]

##### Environment variables, Deployment strategies

Lets change the Greeting message using an environment variable:

[source]
----
oc env dc/camel-springboot-rest GREETING="Environment Variable Hi "
----

By changing the deployment configuration, we will trigger a new deployment. If we browse to our application you might see an HTTP 503, this
is because the jvm and our application is in the process of restarting:

image::/images/28-spring-503.png[HTTP 503 Unavailable,400,align="center"]

The default deployment strategy in OpenShift is the `Rolling` strategy. The rolling strategy performs a rolling update of our application. OpenShift offers *health checks*
 when deploying our applicaiton that tell us when the applicaiton is alive - *liveness* and ready to accept user requests - *readiness*.

It is crucial for correct deployment behaviour that we set them appropriately for our application. We can do this from the command line or web-ui. Lets define a
liveness check for our container that performs a simple shell command (echo), and a readiness check on our API using the spring actuator */health* status that is built in:

[source]
----
oc set probe dc/camel-springboot-rest --liveness -- echo ok
oc set probe dc/camel-springboot-rest --readiness --get-url=//:8080/health --initial-delay-seconds=30 --timeout-seconds=2
----

image::/images/28-spring-health-check.png[Spring Health Check,600,align="center"]

If we watch the deployment in the web-ui - we can see that the old pod is not stopped and removed until the new pod deployment has successfully passed
 our defined liveness and readiness health check probes.

image::/images/28-rolling-deployment.png[Rolling Deployment Strategy,600,align="center"]

Now, once deployment has finished, lets try testing our environment variable configured service in swagger

image::/images/28-env-var-service.png[Enviornment Variable Helloservice,800,align="center"]

Yes - it returns the environment variable version of our greeting.

How did we acheive this? by using setting a preference in our Java code to return an environment variable (as exposed in our container runtime) over the property file:

* https://github.com/eformat/camel-springboot-rest-ose/blob/master/src/main/java/org/example/ApplicationConfigBean.java#L17

image::/images/28-env-var-code.png[Enviornment Variable Code,600,align="center"]

##### Config Maps, Hot Reload

The `ConfigMap` object in OpenShift provides mechanisms to provide configuration data to the application container while keeping the application images both
portable across environments and independent of OpenShift Container Platform. A `ConfigMap` can be used to store key-value properties, configuration files, JSON
blobs and alike.

Lets remove our GREETING environment variable we set previously:

[source]
----
oc env dc/camel-springboot-rest GREETING-
----

And use a ConfigMap to configure our application instead (if you are not using bash shell, it may be easier to copy the yaml into a file instead to create the ConfigMap)

[source]
----
oc create -f - <<EOF
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: helloservice
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    helloservice:
      greeting: ConfigMap Hello 
EOF
----

Now when we test our API, we should see this greeting

image::/images/28-config-map-service.png[ConfigMap Helloservice,600,align="center"]

Our config map greeting has been loaded into out application. If we examine the logs, we can see that a pod/container restart `did not` occur?

Looking at the application logs, we can see what has happened:

image::/images/28-config-map-hotreload.png[Spring Cloud Kubernetes,1200,align="center"]

The application has reloaded the Spring Context (without restarting the JVM) when we changed the ConfigMap

We are making use of `Spring Cloud Kubernetes` - https://github.com/fabric8io/spring-cloud-kubernetes to discover when changes occur to our project

image::/images/28-spring-cloud-kubernetes.png[Spring Cloud Kubernetes,1200,align="center"]

We can `Hot Reload` the config map

[source]
----
oc replace -f - <<EOF
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: helloservice
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    helloservice:
      greeting: hot hot hot  
EOF
----

image::/images/28-hot-reload.png[Hot Reload,600,align="center"]

### Application Performance Managment

Lets deploy a Hawkular APM server to our project using a template

[source]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eformat/hawkular-apm-template/master/templates/hawkular-apm-server-deployment.yml
----

Once the hawkular apm, and elasticsearch images have been deployed and started, you can login to the Hawkular APM Console using 
`admin / password` as the credentials. There won't be any data yet.

We need to set some environment variable on our java application to start instrumenting our app using APM:

[options="header"]
|=======
| Environment Variable | Description
| HAWKULAR_APM_URI | the HTTP URI for accessing your hawkular server (make sure to not use the HTTPS URL, I did not manage to got it working for now),
| HAWKULAR_APM_USERNAME | the username for connecting APM server, use default `admin` user
| HAWKULAR_APM_PASSWORD | the password for connecting APM server, use default admin `password`
| JAVA_OPTIONS | the JVM options for enabling Java agent, use -javaagent:/libs/hawkular-apm-agent.jar=boot:/libs/hawkular-apm-agent.jar that refers to the Hawkular agent previously added to image libs.
|=======

Lets set these on the deployment config

++++
<pre class="highlight">
<code>oc env dc/camel-springboot-rest HAWKULAR_APM_URI=$(oc get route hawkular-apm --template='http://&#123;{ .spec.host }}') \
                                HAWKULAR_APM_USERNAME=admin \
                                HAWKULAR_APM_PASSWORD=password \
                                JAVA_OPTIONS=-javaagent:/libs/hawkular-apm-agent.jar=boot:/libs/hawkular-apm-agent.jar</code>
</pre>
++++

Once re-deployed, we can test our application using the swagger-ui again and we should start seeing traffic in the Hawkular APM console

We can filter by time spanand text, and look the time taken for each call and drilldown into distributed tracing and latency for each rest call.

image::/images/28-hawkular-apm-component.png[APM Component View,1000,align="center"]

We did not have to annotate or modify our code - it works out of the box using the OpenTracing standard - a vendor-neutral open standard for distributed tracing.

image::/images/28-hawkular-apm-drilldown.png[APM Transaction Drilldown,1000,align="center"]

##### Hawt.io

The base Java image also support the hawt.io console (exposes JMX over REST). You can open the java console

image::/images/28-open-java-console.png[Open Java Console,600,align="center"]

to see your Camel Routes in real-time, drilldown into the source code, debug and trace in realtime your camel application

image::/images/28-hawtio-camel-route.png[Hawt.io Camel Routes,1000,align="center"]

as well as see summary aatributes

image::/images/28-camel-messages.png[Camel Route Attributes,1000,align="center"]

##### (Future - Optional) Hawkular OpenShift Agent (HOSA)
